              <p class="virginia"> I grew up in a small town of almost 6,000 people in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia. So small in fact that the street I grew up on carried my surname thanks to my grandparents being the first
                  ones to inhabit the street and us moving into their house when they grew tired of small town life. Although I did enjoy how friday night high school football brought the town together, and knowing most
                  of the local business owners by having classes with their kids, I yearned for more.  In tenth grade, my guidance counselor recommened me to apply for a high school engineering internship at NASA. I initally
                  brushed off the idea because I didn't think I would have a chance of getting accepted, but thankfully I submitted my application in time and was selected as one of twelve kids in the program (and the only 
                  one from southwest Virginia). That pivotal moment in my life ignited a STEM flame that has stuck with me since. </p>
